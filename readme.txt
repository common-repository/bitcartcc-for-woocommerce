Bitcart is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive cryptocurrency payments directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

== Description ==

Bitcart is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive cryptocurrency payments directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.

Bitcart is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the involvement of a third-party. Payments with Bitcart go directly to your wallet, which increases the privacy and security. Your private keys are never uploaded to the server. There is no address re-use since each invoice generates a new address deriving from your xpubkey.

You can run Bitcart as a self-hosted solution on your own server, or use a third-party host.

The self-hosted solution allows you not only to attach an unlimited number of stores and use the Lightning Network but also become the payment processor for others.


* Direct, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency payments
* No transaction fees (other than mining fees by crypto network itself)
* No processing fees

== Installation ==

This plugin requires Woocommerce. Please make sure you have Woocommerce installed.

To integrate Bitcart into an existing WooCommerce store, follow the steps below.

### 1. Install Bitcart WooCommerce Plugin ###

### 2. Deploy Bitcart ###

To launch your Bitcart instance, you can self-host it, or use a third party host.

#### 2.1 Self-hosted Bitcart ####

#### 2.2 Third-party host ####

Those who want to test Bitcart out, or are okay with the limitations of a third-party hosting (dependency and privacy, as well as lack of some features) can use one of the third-party hosts.

### 3. Connecting the store ###

Bitcart WooCommerce plugin is a bridge between your server (payment processor) and your e-commerce store. No matter if you\'re using a self-hosted or third-party solution from step 2, the connection process is identical.

Go to your store dashboard. WooCommerce > Settings > Payments. Click Bitcart.

1. In the field Bitcart URL, enter the full URL of your Bitcart API instance(in most cases api.somedomain.tld) (including the https) â€“ https://api.mydomain.com
2. In the field Bitcart Store ID enter the id of your store(click on copy icon near your store in admin panel to get it), usually it is ID 1 for the first store on your instance.
3. In the field Bitcart Admin Panel URL enter the url(including the https) of your admin panel, like https://admin.mydomain.com
4. You have successfully connected your store! Congratulations!

###  4. Connecting your wallet ###

Don't forget to connect your wallet(s) to your store in admin panel, they will be used for checkout!

### 5. Testing the checkout ###

Making a small test-purchase from your own store, will give you a piece of mind. Always make sure that everything is set up correctly before going live.
